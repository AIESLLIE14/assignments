the university network user sent an email to sam saying to inform him that the network user will expire in 24 hours
and to follow a website to change the password,which is myuniversity.changepassword.
Sam knows that The user is redirected to myuniversity.edurenewal.com, a bogus page appearing exactly like the real renewal page, 
where both new and existing passwords are requested. 
The attacker, monitoring the page, hijacks the original password to gain access to secured areas on the university network.
sam knows this from having a science computuer class.he ends up deleting the emailand goes to the school for the info on his account.
